Components can go through multiple states – initialized, created, started, resumed, destroyed – and the lifecycle methods are called to perform various operations when a state event is triggered. Lifecycle will hold information about the status of a component, dealing with changes in status, and relieving the component of this tasks. The purpose is to write simpler code, easier to understand"
